# ReliantAI
A production-grade framework for monitoring, governing, and assuring AI/ML systems across their lifecycle. This repository provides reference architectures, governance controls, reliability metrics, policy enforcement workflows, and observability patterns to help enterprises deploy trustworthy, compliant, and resilient AI systems at scale.

**Problem**:
Companies are deploying:
LLMs
ML pipelines
AI agents
But they don’t know:
If AI outputs are reliable
If models are compliant
If AI decisions are auditable
If AI drift is happening
If regulators will penalize them
There is NO Snowflake for AI governance yet.

**Solution**:
An AI Governance + Reliability Platform that:

✔ Monitors AI output quality
✔ Detects hallucinations & drift
✔ Tracks data lineage → model → output
✔ Generates regulatory-ready reports
✔ Provides real-time AI risk scoring

**Architecture**: 


**MVP scope**
MVP Scope:
Ingest logs from LLM calls (OpenAI, Bedrock, Azure)
Validate outputs using rules + AI evaluator
Detect anomalies
Show dashboards
Auto-generate compliance reports (PDF)
